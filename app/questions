1) Explain REST

 REST determines how the API looks like. It stands for “Representational State Transfer”. 
 It is a set of rules that developers follow when they create their API. One of these rules 
 states that you should  be able to get a piece of data (called a resource) 
 when you link to a specific URL
REST is a set of architectural constraints. It is neither a protocol nor a standard. API developers can implement REST in a number of ways.

2) Explain the architectural style for the creation of a web API (client server communication, formatting language, number of servers, etc.)
   HTTP for client server communication
   XML/JSON as formatting language
   Simple URI as the address for the services
   Stateless communication

3) What are the best practices when deploying an application in the cloud

   Creating Agile Environments with DevOps
   Creating a Defined Deployment Process
   Adoption of Cloud Automation Processes and Tools
   Security Built-Ins During Deployment
   Applying Kaizen with SDI

4) What are your best strength : infra ? DB ? web ?

since i've created several web projects, I guess i am more experienced in web than the other fields furthermore i am passionate  in creating web applications also it is my speciality in my studies 


5) Among all the projects you have worked on. Which architecture do you enjoy the most? explain why ?

I've being working with the client server architecture and i am quite enjoying it since it easy to implement  also it's easy to replace, repair, upgrade and relocate a server while client remains unaffected . As all the data is stored on the server it's easy to make a back-up of it. ,and  It does not slow down with heavy use .
